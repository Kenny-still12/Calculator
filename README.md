# Calculator

This is the last project of The Odin Project Foundational course.
I'm gonna be honest, without tutorials videos and googling, I would never be able to code the functionality of Calculator.
There is still a lot to learn, and I know that my learning to become front end dev will be a hectic journey, but I am proud of myself finishing the course without quitting (With I have tendency with) :)
